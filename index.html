          <p>
            At Continuuity, we needed a fast, self-service way to provision clusters because 
            testing against real clusters is such a critical and frequent component of our development 
            cycle. Our vision was to enable all Continuuity developers to be able to quickly create a 
            cluster with the push of a button.
          </p>

          <p>
            We started off with simple scripts. But scripts had multiple issues - they required a lot of setup, 
            there was no central management keeping track of available clusters, and the scripts had to be 
            changed whenever we moved from one cloud to another, or one software deployment to another. Next, 
            we started looking at different SCM (software configuration management) technologies and picked Chef. 
            Combining scripts and Chef recipes, we were able to get to one-button push, but it became extremely 
            complex for two reasons -  there were an increasing number of customizations needed for each new type 
            of cluster and a significant amount of setup was needed on every developer’s box. 
          </p>

          <p>
            When we launched our Reactor product, we wanted to enable developers to deploy our single-node 
            Sandbox Reactor to a public cloud directly from the website. This forced us to think harder about 
            designing a complete production system while still providing an easy and flexible solution for our 
            developers. We wrote a combination of scripts and Chef recipes, designed a system that can templatize 
            the Hadoop cluster, added capabilities to make it extendable to other services and providers, and 
            made it very developer and ops friendly - that’s when Loom was born.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, Loom is used to provision Sandbox Reactors on the Continuuity Cloud and as an internal 
            DevOps tool to test new and incremental features on an ongoing basis. We’ve been developing and 
            using Loom for almost a year and we’re noticing the benefits: our developer and DevOps productivity 
            have doubled, and our development and test cycles have become faster. 
          </p>

          <p>
            We built Loom for ourselves. But we believe that the broader developer community can benefit from it, 
            so we're making it available for everyone to use.
          </p>

          <h3><a name="what-is-loom-" class="anchor" href="#what-is-loom-"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Loom?</h3>

          <p>
            Loom is cluster management software that manages clusters on public and private clouds. 
            Clusters created with Loom utilize templates of any hardware and software stack, from simple 
            standalone LAMP-stack servers and traditional application servers like JBoss, to full Apache 
            Hadoop clusters comprised of thousands of nodes. Clusters can be deployed across many cloud 
            providers (Rackspace, Joyent, and OpenStack) while utilizing common SCM tools (Chef and scripts).
            Loom is pluggable so integration with new providers like AWS and new SCM tools like Puppet can
            be added by implementing plugins.
          </p>

          <h3><a name="why-do-i-need-loom-" class="anchor" href="#why-do-i-need-loom-"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why do I need Loom?</h3>

            <h4>Worry-Free Provisioning</h4>
            <p>
              Loom simplifies the installation and configuration of any software stack, including Hadoop, 
              and ensures that all installations are verified before a cluster is made available. Developers 
              can create custom cluster types ranging from single VM application servers to large-scale, 
              distributed, heterogeneous clusters at the push of a button. 
            </p>

            <h4>Automation</h4>
            <p>
              Loom enables the creation of custom cluster templates ranging from Hadoop to LAMP to Solr search clusters. 
              Templates define rules describing how hardware, images, and services should be laid out in a 
              cluster, leaving Loom to solve and coordinate what tasks need to be done in what order to create a 
              cluster. Services are automatically placed on the correct nodes and are configured, initialized, and
              started in the correct order. In this way, the template used to create a 3 node Hadoop cluster with only
              hdfs and YARN can also be used to create a 300 node cluster with hdfs, YARN, and HBase. 
            </p>

            <h4>Flexibility</h4>
            <p>
              Loom integrates with various IaaS providers (currently Rackspace, Joyent and OpenStack) and 
              SCM tools (currently just Chef) out of the box. Loom has a pluggable architecture, so adding 
              a provider or SCM tool can be done by writing a plugin. If your provider or SCM tool is not 
              supported out of the box, simply implement a plugin for it (and contribute back!).  
              Switching between supported providers is even simpler; you simply select a different
              provider from a drop down menu.
            </p>

            <h4>Loom from your laptop</h4>
            <p>
              Loom has been tested on Linux and Mac. It uses little resources and can be used to provision 
              and decommission a cluster directly from a laptop. Loom creates a very simple user API that 
              allows the developer to choose the type of cluster, how many nodes, and which cloud. Any developer 
              can go from zero to Hadoop, from their laptop to any cloud, in minutes.
            </p>

            A standalone version of the current snapshot can be downloaded <a href="http://repository.continuuity.com/loom">here</a>, or built 
            from the source code as described further below. After downloading it, 
            unzip it and follow the instructions in the README to start up Loom on 
            your own machine. It comes pre-packaged with templates for Hadoop and LAMP. 
            In order to create an actual cluster, you will need an account with a supported provider 
            (Rackspace, Openstack, or Joyent), and to perform a couple steps to setup up Loom to use the right 
            credentials to integrate with your provider. Follow the
